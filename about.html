            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Delicious Eats began in 1995 when grandmother Maria brought her treasured recipe book from Italy to
                Brooklyn, New York. Starting with just four tables in a cozy corner storefront, she and her daughter
                Sofia began serving the same hearty dishes that had been passed down through three generations of their
                family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our signature dish, the "Nonna's Secret Lasagna," still follows Maria's original recipe, layered with
                her special blend of three cheeses and slow-cooked ragu that simmers for six hours. Each morning, our
                chefs make fresh pasta by hand, just as Maria did, keeping her tradition of excellence alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, we've grown from that tiny corner spot to become a neighborhood institution, but our
                commitment to authentic, home-style cooking hasn't changed. Sofia's son Marco now leads our kitchen,
                adding his own creative touch while honoring his grandmother's legacy. His modern interpretations, like
                the popular Truffle Mushroom Risotto and Sea Bass al Limone, have earned us recognition in the New York
                Times and Food & Wine magazine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we're proud to source many of our ingredients from local farms, supporting our community while
                ensuring the freshest flavors possible. Our herb garden, started by Maria herself, still provides the
                aromatic basil and oregano that give our dishes their distinctive taste.
